## What is Lockt?

Lockt is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that securely stores your sensitive personal information using **client-side encryption**. This means:

- ‚úÖ **Your data is encrypted on your device** before it's stored anywhere
- ‚úÖ **Zero-knowledge security** - Even Microsoft/OneDrive cannot see your data
- ‚úÖ **Multi-device sync** - Access your data from any device with OneDrive
- ‚úÖ **Works offline** - Access your data even without internet
- ‚úÖ **No account required** - Just a master password and optional OneDrive sync

### What You Can Store

Lockt organizes your data into 5 categories:

1. **Passwords** - Bank logins, website credentials, account numbers
2. **Credit Cards** - Card numbers, expiration dates, security codes
3. **Crypto** - Cryptocurrency wallet addresses and recovery phrases
4. **Freetext** - SSNs, insurance policies, passports, or any custom data
5. **Health** - Medical providers, conditions, impairments, and health journal

---

## Getting Started

---

## First Time Setup

When you open Lockt for the first time, you'll be guided through account creation:

### Step 1: Create Your Master Password

Your master password is the **most important part** of your security:

- ‚úÖ **Make it strong** - At least 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- ‚úÖ **Make it unique** - Don't reuse passwords from other accounts
- ‚úÖ **Make it memorable** - You'll need it every time you unlock Lockt
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you forget it, your data is LOST** - There is no password reset!

**Example Strong Passwords:**
- `MyDog&2Cats!LiveIn2025`
- `Coffee@7am_Every_Day!`
- `I<3Hiking_OnWeekends2024`

### Step 2: Save Your Recovery Phrase

After creating your password, you'll receive a **12-word recovery phrase**:

```
Example: abandon ability able about above absent absorb abstract absurd abuse access accident
```

**CRITICAL - Save This Recovery Phrase:**
- ‚úÖ Write it down on paper and store it safely
- ‚úÖ Take a photo and save it in a secure location (encrypted drive, password manager)
- ‚úÖ Never share it with anyone
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is your ONLY backup if you forget your password!

**Where to Store Your Recovery Phrase:**
- Physical paper in a safe or locked drawer
- Password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass)
- Encrypted USB drive
- Bank safety deposit box (for maximum security)

### Step 3: Connect to OneDrive (Optional)

OneDrive sync is **completely optional** but highly recommended for:
- ‚úÖ Multi-device access (use Lockt on phone, tablet, and computer)
- ‚úÖ Automatic backups (your encrypted data is backed up to the cloud)
- ‚úÖ Data recovery (if you lose your device, your data is safe)

**To connect OneDrive:**
1. Tap "Connect to OneDrive" button
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account
3. Grant Lockt permission to store encrypted files

**Privacy Note:** OneDrive only stores **encrypted** data. Microsoft cannot see your passwords, cards, or any other information. Only you can decrypt it with your master password.

---

## Unlocking Lockt

Every time you open Lockt, you'll need to unlock it:

### Standard Unlock (Password Only)

1. Enter your master password
2. Tap "Unlock"

### Recovery Phrase Unlock (Password Recovery)

If you forgot your password but have your recovery phrase:

1. Tap "üîê Forgot password? Use recovery phrase"
2. The password field disappears (you don't need it!)
3. Enter your 12-word recovery phrase in the text box
4. Tap "Recover & Unlock"
5. Your password is automatically decrypted and you're unlocked!

**How It Works:** During account setup, your password is encrypted using your recovery phrase. When you use recovery mode, the recovery phrase decrypts your password, then your password unlocks your data. It's like having a backup key!

3. Open Lockt on Device B
4. Tap "Sync Now" or wait for auto-sync
5. Changes appear immediately on Device B!

### Conflict Resolution

**What is a conflict?**
A conflict occurs when you modify the same data on two devices before they sync.

**Example:**

- Device B: You add a different password while offline
- Both devices try to sync ‚Üí CONFLICT

**Resolving Conflicts:**
1. Lockt detects the conflict and shows a dialog

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is Lockt free?**
A: Yes, Lockt is completely free and open-source.

**Q: Do I need OneDrive?**
A: No. OneDrive is optional. You can use Lockt entirely offline without any cloud sync. OneDrive is only needed for multi-device sync.

**Q: Can anyone at Microsoft/OneDrive see my data?**
A: No. Your data is encrypted on your device before it's sent to OneDrive. Microsoft only sees encrypted gibberish - they cannot decrypt it without your password.

**Q: Can I use Lockt without installing the app?**
A: Yes. Lockt works in any modern web browser. Installation as a PWA is optional but recommended for better experience.

**Q: Does Lockt work offline?**
A: Yes. Once you've unlocked Lockt, you can view and edit your data without internet. Changes will sync next time you're online.

### Security Questions

**Q: What encryption does Lockt use?**
A: AES-GCM (256-bit keys) with PBKDF2 key derivation (600,000 iterations). This is industry-standard, bank-level encryption.

**Q: What happens if I forget my password?**
A: If you have your recovery phrase, you can use it ALONE to recover your password and unlock your account. The recovery phrase decrypts an encrypted copy of your password stored in Lockt. If you lost both password and recovery phrase, your data is permanently unrecoverable.

**Q: Can Lockt recover my password for me?**
A: No. There is no password reset feature. Your password is encrypted with your recovery phrase and stored locally. Only YOU can decrypt it with your recovery phrase. No one (including Lockt developers or Microsoft) can recover it for you.

**Q: Is my recovery phrase the same as my password?**
A: No. Your recovery phrase is a 12-word backup key that can decrypt your password. During account creation, Lockt encrypts your password using your recovery phrase. If you forget your password, enter your recovery phrase and Lockt will automatically decrypt and use your password to unlock your data.

**Q: How secure is the 12-word recovery phrase?**
A: Extremely secure. There are 2048^12 possible combinations (~5.4 √ó 10^39), which is more secure than most 256-bit encryption keys.

### Sync & Multi-Device Questions

**Q: How do I use Lockt on multiple devices?**
A: Connect to OneDrive on all devices using the same Microsoft account, then unlock with the same master password. Your encrypted data syncs automatically.

**Q: What if I edit data on two devices at the same time?**
A: Lockt detects conflicts and lets you choose which version to keep (local or cloud).

**Q: How long does sync take?**
A: Usually 1-5 seconds. Depends on data size and internet speed.

**Q: Can I sync without OneDrive?**
A: Not currently. OneDrive is the only cloud provider supported. Future versions may support Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.

### Data & Storage Questions

**Q: How much data can I store?**
A: Practically unlimited. Your data is stored as a single encrypted file. Most users will have files under 1 MB, which is tiny.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: Two places:
1. Your device (IndexedDB in your browser)
2. OneDrive (if connected) - encrypted in a hidden app folder

**Q: Can I export my data?**
A: Not yet. Phase 5 (future update) will add export to JSON, CSV, and TXT formats.

**Q: What happens if I delete Lockt?**
A: If you delete the app or clear browser data:
- Local data is deleted from your device
- If connected to OneDrive, your encrypted data is still in the cloud
- Reinstall Lockt, sign in to OneDrive, and download your data

**Q: Can I share entries with someone?**
A: Not yet. Sharing will be added in Phase 7 as an encrypted link feature.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What browsers does Lockt support?**
A: Any modern browser:
- ‚úÖ Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera (Chromium-based)
- ‚úÖ Safari (iOS, macOS)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚ùå Internet Explorer (not supported)

**Q: What's a PWA?**
A: Progressive Web App - a website that works like a native app. It can be installed on your home screen, work offline, and send notifications.

**Q: Does Lockt use any trackers or analytics?**
A: No. Lockt does not collect any analytics, telemetry, or usage data. 100% privacy-focused.

**Q: Is Lockt open source?**
A: Yes. You can view the source code on GitHub and verify the security yourself.
