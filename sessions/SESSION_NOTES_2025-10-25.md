# Session Notes - October 25, 2025

## Session Overview

**Duration**: Extended session (continued from previous context)
**Focus**: Bug fixes and security feature implementation for Lockt PWA
**Status**: ✅ All tasks completed, built, committed, and documented

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Bug Fixes (5 critical issues from production testing)

#### Bug #1: Recovery Phrase Generation - Duplicates and All "A" Words ✅
**Problem**: Recovery phrases had duplicate words and were all "A" words (occasionally 2 "Z" words)
**Root Cause**: Stub wordlist only had 18 words (abandon→acid, zone, zoo)
**Fix**: Imported full BIP39 wordlist (2048 words) from official Bitcoin specification
**Files Modified**:
- Created `src/utils/bip39-wordlist.ts` with complete wordlist
- Updated `src/services/crypto.service.ts` to import and use BIP39_WORDLIST

#### Bug #2: Conflict Resolution Sending to Setup Screen ✅
**Problem**: When choosing cloud version in conflict, page reloaded and showed setup screen
**Root Cause**: `window.location.reload()` after downloading cloud version wiped unlocked state
**Fix**: Implemented `reloadFromDatabase()` method that decrypts IndexedDB data into memory without page reload
**Files Modified**:
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Added `reloadFromDatabase()` method (lines 188-214)
- `src/context/SyncContext.tsx` - Replaced page reload with `reloadFromDatabase()` calls

#### Bug #3: UI Not Refreshing After Sync ✅
**Problem**: Downloaded data saved to IndexedDB but UI didn't update (required app restart)
**Root Cause**: Downloaded data wasn't being decrypted into in-memory app state
**Fix**: Added `reloadFromDatabase()` calls after all download operations in SyncContext
**Files Modified**:
- `src/context/SyncContext.tsx` - Integrated `reloadFromDatabase()` into sync workflows

#### Bug #4: Recovery Phrase Requiring Password (CRITICAL DESIGN FLAW) ✅
**Problem**: Recovery phrase login required BOTH password AND recovery phrase
**User Feedback**: "I thought the purpose of passphrases was in case you lost or forgot your password?"
**Root Cause**: Recovery phrase was never used for encryption, only for validation
**Fix**: Implemented **password escrow pattern** - encrypt password with recovery phrase during setup, decrypt password with recovery phrase during recovery unlock
**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/crypto.service.ts` - Added `encryptPasswordWithRecoveryPhrase()` and `decryptPasswordWithRecoveryPhrase()` methods
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated `unlock()` to support recovery-phrase-only mode, `createAccount()` to encrypt password with recovery phrase
- `src/components/auth/LoginScreen.tsx` - Added recovery mode UI toggle, hide password field in recovery mode
- `src/services/database.service.ts` - Store encrypted password in IndexedDB config

**Security Model**:
- Password encrypted with recovery phrase during account creation
- Stored in IndexedDB as `encryptedPassword`
- Recovery phrase can decrypt password automatically
- User unlocks with recovery phrase alone (no password needed)

#### Bug #5: OneDrive Crash on iPhone PWA ⚠️
**Problem**: OneDrive sign-in crashes after initial sign-in on primary iPhone (other devices work)
**Root Cause**: MSAL browser cache corruption on specific device
**Fix**: Documented cache clearing procedure (not a code fix)
**Status**: Workaround documented in USER_GUIDE.md troubleshooting section

---

### 2. Password Change Feature Implementation ✅

**User Request**: "Is it possible to change the password should it be compromised?"
**Discovery**: No password change feature existed - critical security gap
**User Choice**: Selected Option 1 (keep same recovery phrase when changing password)

#### Implementation Details

**Files Created**:
1. `src/components/settings/ChangePasswordForm.tsx` (264 lines)
   - Main password change form component
   - Conditional UI based on unlock method
   - Validation for password match, length (8+ chars), recovery phrase (12 words)
   - Success/error handling with toast notifications

2. `src/components/settings/SettingsScreen.tsx` (57 lines)
   - Container for security settings
   - Currently holds ChangePasswordForm
   - Extensible for future settings

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Added `unlockedViaRecovery: boolean` state (line 24, 48)
   - Added `changePassword()` method (lines 291-372)
   - Track unlock method in `unlock()` (line 162)
   - Reset unlock method in `lock()` (line 179)

2. `src/components/layout/TabNavigation.tsx`
   - Added 'settings' to Tab type (line 5)
   - Added Settings tab to navigation array (line 18)

3. `src/App.tsx`
   - Added SettingsScreen import (line 13)
   - Added Settings routing (line 131)

#### Password Change Security Flow

```typescript
// 1. Determine actual current password
if (unlockedViaRecovery) {
  actualCurrentPassword = password; // Use stored password from AuthContext
} else {
  actualCurrentPassword = currentPassword; // Verify provided password
  await cryptoService.decrypt(encryptedData, currentPassword); // Throws if wrong
}

// 2. Verify recovery phrase is correct
const storedEncryptedPassword = await databaseService.getConfig('encryptedPassword');
const decryptedPassword = await cryptoService.decryptPasswordWithRecoveryPhrase(
  storedEncryptedPassword,
  recoveryPhrase
);
if (decryptedPassword !== actualCurrentPassword) {
  throw new Error('Recovery phrase is incorrect');
}

// 3. Re-encrypt all data with new password (and new salt for forward secrecy)
const newSalt = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16));
const newEncryptedData = await cryptoService.encrypt(
  JSON.stringify(appData),
  newPassword,
  newSalt
);

// 4. Encrypt new password with same recovery phrase
const newEncryptedPassword = await cryptoService.encryptPasswordWithRecoveryPhrase(
  newPassword,
  recoveryPhrase
);

// 5. Save everything to IndexedDB
await databaseService.saveEncryptedData(newEncryptedData);
await databaseService.setConfig('salt', newEncryptedData.salt);
await databaseService.setConfig('encryptedPassword', newEncryptedPassword);

// 6. Update in-memory password (stay unlocked)
setPassword(newPassword);
```

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Same Recovery Phrase**: Recovery phrase remains unchanged when password changes
   - Simpler UX (only one recovery phrase to remember)
   - Recovery phrase can still decrypt new password
   - New password is encrypted with same recovery phrase

2. **Conditional Current Password**: Skip verification if unlocked via recovery
   - If user unlocked with recovery phrase, they don't know their current password
   - Use stored password from AuthContext state instead
   - UI hides current password field in this case

3. **Recovery Phrase Verification Required**:
   - Ensures user still has access to recovery phrase
   - Prevents unauthorized password changes
   - Verified by decrypting stored encrypted password

4. **Forward Secrecy**: New salt generated when changing password
   - Extra security layer
   - Old encrypted data cannot be correlated with new

5. **Stay Unlocked**: App remains unlocked after password change
   - In-memory password updated
   - No need for user to re-authenticate

## Technical Patterns Established

### 1. Password Escrow Pattern
**Purpose**: Allow recovery phrase to act as password replacement
**Implementation**:
- Encrypt password with recovery phrase during account creation
- Store encrypted password in IndexedDB config
- Decrypt password with recovery phrase during recovery unlock
- User can unlock with recovery phrase alone (no password needed)

**Files**:
- `src/services/crypto.service.ts` - Escrow encryption/decryption methods
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Integration into unlock/createAccount flows
- `src/services/database.service.ts` - Storage of encrypted password

### 2. reloadFromDatabase() Pattern
**Purpose**: Refresh UI after sync operations without page reload
**Implementation**:
- Decrypt latest IndexedDB data into memory
- Use stored password from AuthContext
- Update in-memory state immediately
- Prevents losing unlocked state

**Files**:
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx:188-214` - Method implementation
- `src/context/SyncContext.tsx` - Integration into sync workflows

**When to Use**:
- After downloading data from OneDrive
- After conflict resolution with "download-remote" action
- Any time IndexedDB is updated externally (not through AuthContext update methods)

### 3. Unlock Method Tracking Pattern
**Purpose**: Conditional UX based on how user unlocked the app
**Implementation**:
- Boolean flag `unlockedViaRecovery` in AuthContext
- Set during unlock based on parameters (password vs recovery phrase)
- Used to skip current password verification in password change
- Reset on lock

**Files**:
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx:24,48,162,179` - State management
- `src/components/settings/ChangePasswordForm.tsx:80-87` - Conditional UI

- ✅ Strict mode enabled
- ✅ No `any` types introduced

### Testing Performed
- ✅ Build successful (`npm run build`)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ No linting errors

### Code Review Notes
- All new code follows existing patterns
- Styled-components match PayTrax aesthetic
- Error handling with try/catch and toast notifications
- Comprehensive validation before operations
- Clear console logging for debugging

---

## Security Considerations

### What Was Enhanced
1. **Password Change Capability**: Users can now change compromised passwords
2. **Recovery Phrase Verification**: Required for password changes (proves user has it)
3. **Forward Secrecy**: New salt generated with each password change
4. **Conditional Verification**: Smart handling of recovery vs normal unlock modes

### Security Properties Maintained
- ✅ Zero-knowledge encryption (OneDrive cannot decrypt)
- ✅ Master password never stored in plaintext
- ✅ Recovery phrase never stored (only used to encrypt/decrypt password)
- ✅ All data re-encrypted with new password on change
- ✅ Client-side encryption (Web Crypto API)
- ✅ 600,000 PBKDF2 iterations (OWASP 2024 recommendation)

### What Is Encrypted
- User data (passwords, credit cards, crypto, freetext, health)
- Master password (encrypted with recovery phrase)
- All stored in IndexedDB as encrypted blobs
- Synced to OneDrive as encrypted blobs

### What Is NOT Encrypted
- Salt (needed for key derivation, stored in IndexedDB config)
- App metadata (version, deviceId, timestamps)
- MSAL tokens (handled by MSAL library in localStorage)

---

## Known Limitations

### Still Outstanding from Phase 3a
1. **No Salt Recovery** - If IndexedDB deleted, encrypted data on OneDrive can't be recovered without salt
   - Mitigation: Store salt in localStorage + OneDrive (future enhancement)

2. **Silent Conflict Resolution** - Auto-resolves to "most recent" without always asking user
   - Mitigation: Dialog UI for user choice (future enhancement)

3. **No Sync Settings UI** - Users can't control auto-sync frequency, Wi-Fi only, etc.
   - Mitigation: Settings UI for sync preferences (future enhancement)

4. **Limited Retry Logic** - Failed syncs don't retry automatically
   - Mitigation: Exponential backoff retry (future enhancement)

### iPhone PWA OneDrive Crash (Bug #5)
- **Issue**: Specific to one iPhone installation
- **Workaround**: Clear Safari cache and reinstall PWA
- **Root Cause**: MSAL browser cache corruption
- **Status**: Documented in troubleshooting, not a code fix

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Recovery Phrase Flow
**Before**: Required BOTH password AND recovery phrase (broken)
**After**: Recovery phrase alone unlocks app (password automatically decrypted)

### Conflict Resolution
**Before**: Page reload → setup screen → user confused
**After**: Seamless state update → stay unlocked → UI refreshes automatically

### Password Change
**Before**: No way to change password (security risk)
**After**: Full password change feature in Settings tab with recovery phrase verification

### UI Refresh After Sync
**Before**: Manual app restart required to see synced changes
**After**: Automatic UI refresh using `reloadFromDatabase()` pattern

---

## Next Steps (Not Done This Session)

### Immediate (User Action Required)
1. **Git Push**: Push 5 commits to origin/main
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Test on Devices**: Test password change feature on iPhone, iPad, desktop

### Future Enhancements (Phase 3a Completion)
1. **Salt Recovery** - Store salt in localStorage + OneDrive for disaster recovery
2. **Conflict Resolution UI** - User dialog for choosing local vs remote version
3. **Sync Settings UI** - Control auto-sync, frequency, Wi-Fi only
4. **Retry Logic** - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
5. **Sync Status UI** - Visual indicators, last sync time, connection status

### Future Phases (Phase 4+)
- Biometric authentication (WebAuthn, Face ID, Touch ID)
- Export functionality (JSON, CSV, TXT)
- Import from backup files
- Auto-lock after inactivity
- Dark mode theme
- Browser extension for auto-fill

## Key Learnings

### Design Patterns
1. **Password Escrow** > **Dual-Key Derivation**: Simpler to implement and understand
2. **In-Memory State Update** > **Page Reload**: Better UX, preserves unlocked state
3. **Conditional UI** > **One-Size-Fits-All**: Better UX for different unlock methods
4. **Recovery Phrase Verification**: Critical security check for sensitive operations

### User Feedback Integration
- User caught critical design flaw (Bug #4) - recovery phrase should work alone
- User requested password change feature - discovered security gap
- User testing revealed edge cases (conflict resolution, UI refresh)

### Technical Decisions
- BIP39 wordlist: Industry standard, 2048 words, no duplicates
- Same recovery phrase on password change: Simpler UX
- Forward secrecy: New salt on password change
- Stay unlocked: Better UX after password change
